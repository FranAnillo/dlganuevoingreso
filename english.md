# Third Grade

## MVG

The project will continue as it was programmed.

Lessons will take place using Collaborate and attendance will continue to be compulsory.

## AI

Professors will continue to upload materials to the subject's webpage (theory and exercises). They have catched up with the students again, starting classes or explications.

More detailed explanations will be uploaded if possible as well.

A forum will be available on the webpage to ask questions.

The project topics will be provided shortly since it is possible to develop them during the quarantine.

The evaluation system will be reviewed according to the evolution of the situation.

## DP2

Theory classes will be provided as videos available in Ense√±anza Virtual. A forum is now also available inside the 'Debates' section to solve any doubt. In future weeks a specific time frame will be provided to answer questions regarding the videos.

Lab sessions will take place in 'Collaborate' during their regular schedule. Each member should be online during the session and the teacher will follow up group by group to check how the project is being developed for 20 minutes. 


Sprint planning will stay the same except that the 66% user cases goal is now reduced to 50% for the first sprint. This change will not affect the following ones.

Tutorials will be attended by email and, if necessary, by video call.

If any student is not in the correct EV group please contact the teacher in charge.

The teachers are studying alternatives for Erasmus students, like subtitles in videos. If any change is madre, they will make an announcement.
